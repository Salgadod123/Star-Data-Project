# Star Data Project
Analysis of star data
Star Data Exploration & Clustering Project

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world astronomical data by exploring and analyzing a star catalog. The focus was on data filtering, SQL querying, visualization, and machine learning clustering, all done in a Jupyter notebook environment.
 Skills Demonstrated

    Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, with various plot styles (scatter plots, histograms, log-log scales, and cluster visualizations)

    Data cleaning and filtering, including handling placeholder values and interpreting astrophysical data quirks (like logarithmic binning and distance estimation)

    Machine learning clustering with KMeans to find structure in high-dimensional stellar features

    SQL querying  for selective data extraction and logic-based filtering

    Use of logarithmic axes and transformations to better visualize astronomical scale data

Highlights

    Handled large datasets with repetitive values

    Used clustering to separate different populations of stars based on physical properties

    Applied log transformations to bring out relationships hidden in linear space

    Explored plotting challenges in Jupyter and GitHub display environments
